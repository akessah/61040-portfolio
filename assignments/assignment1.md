# Akosua Essah Assignment 1: Problem Framing
## Domains
1. Running: Competing on the track at the high school and college level
2. ***Books***: I've enjoyed reading as my primary hobby for most of my life. I like to novels, especially science fiction, fantasy, and speculative fiction. Ever since I started college, I've beem reading much less, mostly because I've been busy with all my classes and activities, so I'm interested in finding ways to make reading as a hobby easier so that I can do it more often.
3. Restauraunts: Eating out at restaurants in my community, both alone and with family and friends
4. Movies: Watching new movies at the movie theater
5. Instruments: Playing string instruments in an ensemble setting
6. ***Travelling***: I like to travel and experience life in new cities and countries. I've been to most states in the eastern half of the US along with Canada and Ghana. I would love to travel more as I get older and would love to ease the difficulties that come with moving through an unfamiliar place so that we have more time to enjoy the sights and experiences.
7. Studying: Maximizing my learning and understanding outside of the classroom
8. Cleaning: Keeping the space I live in both clean and organized
9. ***Cooking***: I love eating good food, but eating out can be timely and expensive. I would like cook more so that I don't have to eat at the dining hall all the time, but cooking is seen as a difficult skill by many people. I'm interested in finding ways to make cooking easier for both myself and my friends around me who want more food options.
10. Clothes: Buying clothes I like, both in person and online, and styling them in an aesthetically pleasing way

## Problems
- Books
    1. ***Finding a book you want to read***: I know from personal experience that sometimes you're in the mood to read something but don't know how to find a book that fulfills that desire. As someone who has tried many ways to find a good book recommendation, I have some insight into the frustrations of current solutions and a starting idea of what people might be looking for
    2. Getting too distracted to read: I've found that when I get too distracted, physically distancing myself from my phone and laptop help the most, so I'm not sure a software solution is something I should pursue
    3. ***Finding the actual book once you know what you want***: Again, in my personal experience, I've spent a lot of time trying to find the best deals on books given a limited budget, so I know there are lot of difficulties that can end up turning people off of reading all together
- Travelling
    1. Coming up with activities to do: Many people who travel do so to go outside their familiar comfort zone, so recommending activities based on things they already like may not be what most tourists want. A static list, like on popular tourist sites, may be a better fit for what they want
    2. Being unaware of crucial cultural differences between where you're from and where you are: This is information that can be looked up online and if you aren't someone who would look it up you probably also aren't someone who would download an app or use a program for that
    3. Handling medical emergencies in foreign countries: This is another problem that is best handled with information easily found online, so I'm not sure this would be a valuable project to pursue
- Cooking
    1. ***Coordinating the timing of cooking different things***: Even with what little cooking I know how to do, I know that a couple minutes can turn a perfectly backed cake into a burnt one. It's easy to get distracted, however, and lose track of time. Even if I do remeber to set an alarm, sometimes it's unclear how long I should set it for
    2. Finding time to cook: This is an issue that many have, but is a more general time management problem, which there are many tools to help with already
    3. Not knowing the nutritional value of foods made at home: There are many proposed solutions to this already and this is not a problem I'm super passionate about, so I don't believe I would have any new insights into this

## Stakeholders
- Picking a book
    1. Authors: If an author's book is recommended more, they'll likely see more sales, which is desirable for them
    2. Readers: Reader would benefit from finding books they're in the mood for
    3. Publishers: Like authors, publishers are invested in seeing the success of their books, so they would like their books to be promoted more
- Finding the book you want
    1. Booksellers: Booksellers would want their venues to be promoted more to gain more business, though they may suffer from cheaper options being more accessible to consumers
    2. Libraries: Libraries would likely see a boost if promoted by a site, since they are an option for getting free books
    3. Readers: Readers would benefit from seeing the most affordable options for getting books, helping them to save money
- Coordinating timing for cooking
    1. Home cooks: Non professional cooks who don't necessarily have the timing intuition professionals have would benefit from having a tool help them stay organized, helping them make better food and gain more confidence in cooking
    2. Families and friends of home cooks: If a home cook is more able to successfully balance more dishes, families and friends may get more and better food to eat
    3. Emergency services: Cooking is one of the leading causes of house fires (see below), so emergency service workers, who generally want to decrease the number of emergencies, would be investing in making sure people don't overcook/burn their food

    - [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/): This is the biggest platform for book reviews. Despite having a wide userbase and extensive tag system, it's not seen as a great place for recommendations. It has a limited search feature where you can't search multiple tags/genres at once and an outdated UI that can be a turnoff. It's also easy for a book to get buried if it's not new or extremely popular
